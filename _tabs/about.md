## Who Am I

Hi! I’m XMengH (she/her), a graduate of the School of Computer Science at Wuhan University. 

I’m currently working on kernel and virtualization technologies. I used to be passionate about front-end development, and I still enjoy exploring new ideas across different areas of tech. 

Happy to meet everyone on the internet!
